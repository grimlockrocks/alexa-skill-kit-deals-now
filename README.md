A sample Alexa Skill Kit that tells you the frontpage deals from Slickdeals RSS feed: https://slickdeals.net/newsearch.php?mode=frontpage&searcharea=deals&searchin=first&rss=1

Note that this skill is not production ready due to the following reasons:
* Listening to deals from Alexa is quite different user experience from reading on the website. The speech and pace need to be natural. For example, "50' Toshiba 50L420U 1080p LED HDTV, $250" should sound like "Fifty inch Toshiba ten-eighty-p LED HDTV for 250 dollars" from Alexa. 
* There is no clear action that users can take after hearing the deals. One possible action is to make a purchase, similar to Amazon's own "Alexa, what are your deals?": https://www.amazon.com/b?node=14552177011
